PD meaning Put data go to the given memory location and then print the data at that location into the output file

instruction counter first sets to that instruction and that instruction is called into IR the size will be always 4 B

LR Load register with the given memory location in to the generel purpose register

SR Store register meaning store the data in the register to the given memory location

CR Compare register compare the data in the registers and return true or false

Branch on true: based on a c variables value we will decide whether we will branch or not.

When will C will be true?
When the Compare register will return true C will be true.
else it will store false;

$DTA is a control card which represents DATA and tells that the DATA is coming as an input in the next line.

(SI- Service Interrupt)
INterrupt 1 - For user input
INterrupt 2- Data put in the output file
Interrupt 3 - Termination Of Program

IN the memory we have 100 words 10 
word meaning 1 block memory is of 10 blocks with 
word size of 4B

Get Data and Put Data works on Block 
and remaining word data 

$AMJ000500150 003- represents no of datalines 

GD, SR takes 2 sec max to run 
and rest takes 1 sec
