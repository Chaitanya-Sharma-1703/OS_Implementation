Phase 2:
paging 10 words
page table entry == ptr + va/10;
RA = M[PT]*10 + VA%10;
PTE = Page table entry;
PTR = Page table register(stores start location of the page table entry)
VA = Virtual Address

Here page table is allocated by OS randomly in the matrix grid of 300X4;

PI=1 OP code error;
PI =2 Operand error; 
PI = 3 page fault;

GD and SR will always give valid page fault;
MOS = terminate, GD, PD and error resolving
